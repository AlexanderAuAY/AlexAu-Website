        <p>Ya know I never considered the possibilty of A Million Little Things or Manifest being copycats or what shows like that should be called ripoffs of THIS is US speaking of (don't read this part of the post if you haven't seen the promo or the show)THis US its promo was misleading because it makes it seem like their strangers with a connection when their actually related but I'm sick and tired of Dramas and don't have interest in New Amsterdam either there just seems to be to many of them at least on broadcast tv and other types of TVgenres like sitcoms in other types of Traditional television at least the type I've seenwhat I would like to see is Speculative fiction for those who don't know its a subgenre Sci-fi, Fantasy, Horror, and the Weird, the miniseries Dinotopia turned into a tv show, Mythquest brought back, a updated Outer Limits that could go along with Black Mirror and the newest Twilight Zone reboot CBS is working on for their streaming subscription service CBS all access, more shows that feel like the ones I grew up watching but in more than one genre and even subgenre not just fantasy or the punks, Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Cyber but Pulp Fiction a genre that came from Magazine novels called Pulps because of the wood they were made from minus worldview and content problems like sensuality, high levels of violence and a combination of immorality and amorality and subgenres of subgenres like Steamfunk and Dieselfunk and of course originals though I have other issues with broadcast tv like the writing and the whole look they seem in fact I watched some promos of new shows from NBC, CBS, and other broadcast shows and they turn them apart.</p>
